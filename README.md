# Victorian_Covid_Exposure_Sites_Checker

### What
- A little tool I built to check if I have been to any of the Victorian COVID-19 exposure sites
- Just put in suburbs you've been to into the locations.json file and run (check your spelling :P)

### How
- Gets data from the DHHS Exposure site CKAN Data API, and checks for matches on locations.json

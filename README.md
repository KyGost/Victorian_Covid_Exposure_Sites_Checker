# Victorian_Covid_Exposure_Sites_Checker

### What
- A little tool I built to check if you have been to any of the tier 1\* Victorian COVID-19 exposure sites
\* The API has changed to only show tier 1 sites because it is becoming too hard to track with so many cases.

### How To Use It
- Just put in suburbs you've been to, into the locations.json file and run (check your spelling :P)


### How It Works
- Gets data from the DHHS Exposure site CKAN Data API, and checks for matches on locations.json
